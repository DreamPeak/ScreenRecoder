ScreenRecoder
=============
A screenrecorder in Android KitKat.



This is a proof-of-concept project. 

I just try to use some new stuffs in KitKat to implement a screen record function in pure Java.

Capturing screen out of your app need one protected permission.(CAPTURE_VIDEO_OUTPUT)
It works well but you need to sign apk with platform key.

How it works
